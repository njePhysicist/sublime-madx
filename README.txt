Sublime Package for MAD-X (Methodical Acclerator Design) 
This includes a syntax defition, very simple build system specification, theme with mad-x specific keys.

Some auxiliary files (.py) help build the repository needed for the syntax definition. These are not part of the
package as needed by Sublime Text.
